# OpenUri
adapt the file provider permission for android 7.0  

* no need to worry about the manifest.xml

* just 2 lines of java code

* no need to care about the specific path, all path is permission granted temporary, so you can use the file object as usual

  â€‹

# usage

```
Uri uri = OpenUri.fromFile(context,file);

OpenUri.addPermissionRW(intent);
//or only read by addPermissionR
```

then you can use the intent as usual:

```
 intent.setDataAndType(uri, "image/*");
  ...
```

}
```
